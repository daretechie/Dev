# Day 2 - Numbers, Variables, and Strings
This is meant as a reference to the concepts of Numbers, Variables, and Strings in Python.

### Numbers
Number can either be Integer (Whole Number) - 2, 3000, 234 or Float (Number with Decimal) - 4.7, 56.7778

#### Mathematical Operations

Adding
```
10 + 10
```
Multiply
```
9 * 32
```
Divide

24 / 6

Exponent 

4 ** 2

Modulo (Remainder)

24 % 5

Greater Than

55 > 22

Less Than

132 < 123

### Strings
The way of representing alphabetic characters in programming is string. In python, it will start and end with quotation mark

```python
>>> my_string = "hello world"

# Length of a string
>>> len(my_string)
11

# Access a character from a string
>>> my_string[4]
'o'
```


### Variables
Variable is used to hold or house information for immediate or later used.

```python
 
>>> greeting = 'Hello World!'
