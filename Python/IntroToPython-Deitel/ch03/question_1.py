# TODO: 1 (Validating User Input) Modify the script of Fig3.3. to validate its
#  inputs. For any input, if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping
#  until the user enters a correct value. Use one counter to keep track of the
#  number of passes, then calculate the number of failures after all the userâ€™s
#  inputs have been received.
